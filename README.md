Project Description:

This mini project, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allows users to track their progress on LeetCode by entering their LeetCode profile ID. The app interacts with LeetCode’s public API to retrieve the number of problems a user has solved in three distinct difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Upon entering the user ID, the app fetches data on all the problems solved by the user and categorizes them based on difficulty. It then displays the number of solved and unsolved problems in each difficulty category, helping users get a quick overview of their problem-solving journey.

Features:

User Profile Input: Users input their LeetCode profile ID to fetch personal data.
API Integration: The app uses LeetCode's public API to fetch and display the user's problem-solving data.
Problem Categorization: Displays the number of problems solved and unsolved in three difficulty levels – Easy, Medium, and Hard.
Dynamic Stats: Shows a breakdown of the number of solved and unsolved problems in each difficulty category.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be mobile-friendly and provides a user-friendly interface.
Error Handling: Handles invalid LeetCode IDs or failure to fetch data from the API, ensuring the user experience is smooth.


Tech Stack:

HTML: For creating the basic structure and layout of the webpage.
CSS: For styling the page, making it visually appealing and responsive across devices.
JavaScript: For handling the logic of fetching data from the LeetCode API, processing the results, and dynamically displaying them.
LeetCode API: A public API that provides the data on the user's solved and unsolved problems, categorized by difficulty.


How it works:

The user enters their LeetCode profile ID into the input field.
The app fetches data from LeetCode’s public API, retrieving problem-solving stats such as the number of problems solved and unsolved in each difficulty category.
The app processes and categorizes the data into three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
The app then displays the number of solved and unsolved problems for each category, providing users with a clear overview of their progress.


This project is a great tool for LeetCode users to visualize and track their problem-solving journey by seeing how many problems they've solved across different difficulty levels. It's perfect for anyone who wants to track their progress or stay motivated by visually seeing their accomplishments.
